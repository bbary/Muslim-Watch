# Garmin-Watch


This watch displaying one of God names in arabic every 3 hours. 
It gives hijri date and time to next prayer. 
I used Aladhan.com API to get prayers time each day, you need to have internet (bleutooth connexion to your phone, or wifi) to work.

You can configure your calculation method using the link in settings (Connect IQ app settings). to do so, see the documenation here

I developped this watch app for my Fenix 6X pro (280px), if your watch is smaller, the display may be different or may go outside the screen.
